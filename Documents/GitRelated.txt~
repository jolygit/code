1. To copy repository from github (for example repository https://github.com/jolygit/test.git which is assumed to be created earlier on github.com) do the following:
   a. Create directory where it all goes for example by (joli:~ aj$ mkdir test in your home directory ) 
   b. Go to the directory you have just created (joli:~ aj$ cd test)  
   c. Initialize git by (joli:test aj$ git init)
   d. Add remote to just created git repository by (joli:test aj$ git remote add origin https://github.com/jolygit/test.git )
   e. Pull contents from remote repository i.e from https://github.com/jolygit/test.git to your local directory by (joli:test aj$ git pull origin master)
That is it!
2. To commit your changes to your local repository do (joli:test aj$ git commit -m "added few lines to test.txt" test.txt ) this assumes that test.txt is already in the repository and you want to commit it after have edited few lines.
3. To send your changes to remote repository do (joli:test aj$ git push  origin master) you will be asked user name which is jolygit and pswd which is aleko123
4. To get latest from remote repo to your local branch do (joli:test aj$ git pull  origin master)
5. To update your origin/master from remote origin/master do (joli:test aj$ git fetch) this leaves your local master branch unchanged and now you can see the differances between what has been added to remote orignin/master and your local master branch by (joli:test aj$ git diff  origin/master master)
