P.s (pdb is a shell script that is located in /home/alex/bin/)

2. To comment selected code in python mode do M-; Use same command to uncomment
3. M-< to go to beginnnig of the buffer and M-> to go to end respectively
4. To start emacs press super+e to close a window press super+shft+c

		 to the center of the screen.
		 (That's CONTROL-L, not CONTROL-1.)
7.      C-f	Move forward a character

	C-a	Move to beginning of line
	C-e	Move to end of line

	M-a	Move back to beginning of sentence

8. Try M-< now, to move to the beginning of the tutorial.
   Then use C-v repeatedly to move back here.

   Try M-> now, to move to the end of the tutorial.
   Then use M-v repeatedly to move back here.
9. If the computer crashes, you can recover your auto-saved editing by
finding the file normally (the file you were editing, not the auto
save file) and then typing M-x recover-file <Return>.  When it asks for
confirmation, type yes<Return> to go ahead and recover the auto-save
data.
10.  Type M-x make-frame <Return>.
   See a new frame appear on your screen.

You can do everything you did in the original frame in the new frame.
There is nothing special about the first frame.

    Type M-x delete-frame <Return>.
   This removes the selected frame.
11. Frame Commands

The following commands are used to delete and operate on frames:

C-x 5 0
Delete the selected frame (delete-frame). This signals an error if there is only one frame.

C-z
Minimize (or “iconify) the selected Emacs frame (suspend-frame). See Exiting.

C-x 5 o
Select another frame, and raise it. If you repeat this command, it cycles through all the frames on your terminal.

C-x 5 1
Delete all frames on the current terminal, except the selected one.

M-<F10>
Toggle the maximization state of the current frame. When a frame is maximized, it fills the screen.

<F11>
Toggle fullscreen mode for the current frame. (The difference between “fullscreen” and “maximized” is normally that the former hides window manager decorations, giving slightly more screen space to Emacs itself.)

12.  Type M-x make-frame <Return>.
   See a new frame appear on your screen.

You can do everything you did in the original frame in the new frame.
There is nothing special about the first frame.

    Type M-x delete-frame <Return>.
   This removes the selected frame.
13. M-g M-g <line#> to go to that line 
14. M-x customize-variable RET visible-bell RET # and turn it on to blink the screen instead of alarm sound
