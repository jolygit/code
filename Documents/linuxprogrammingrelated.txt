1. When dealing with file permissions and various access permissions it is important to realize that when exec file is owned by say root which grants execute permissions, like in:
[aj@localhost proccred]$ ls -l
-rwsrwxr-x. 1 root aj 26104 Jul 20 07:03 idshow
if you say user aj run this program, process credentials will be set as follows:
UID: real=aj (1000); eff=root (0); saved=root (0); fs=root (0);
in other words real user id of the process is aj, not the owner of the executable.

2. When linking c library against c++ code you have to use extern "C"{ func()} pattern; see ~/code/c++/IM/src/server.cpp
